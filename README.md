Hangman Pygame
This is a hangman game, which uses Python's Pygame library.
If you would like to try it, you can save the repository on your local machine and run it like so:
- install pygame if you do not have it installed yet by running one of these commands: 'pip install pygame', or, if that doesn't work, 'python3 -m pip install pygame'
- enter the repository: 'cd hangman'
- once you're inside the repository, run 'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py' - the window should pop up and you should be able to play the game
